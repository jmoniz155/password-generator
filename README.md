## Description
[Description](#description)
This is where I use my knowledge in javascript to build this project Password Generator.  This project is a step by step build by logging in a password that is greater than the number 8 and less than the number 128. 


How this works is when you click generate password the page asks you what is your password. If your number is less than 8 or greater than 128 an invalid length will apprear and will ask you to try again. When your number is within the range needed if will ask you a series of question which you will have to answer yes to at least 1 question.  It will then generate a password of number, upper and lowercase letter as well as special functions. It will then generate a random password for you. If anything doesnt matcth

I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for helping me understand how to use javascript building a password generator.  I have learned so much in this assignment. Really taking the time to explain how to read and understand the acceptance criteria to generate code and using google.


If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
